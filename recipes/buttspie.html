    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious pie with a rich butterscotch flavor and a hint of cinnamon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pre-made pie crust</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter (4 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thaw unbaked pie crust and roll onto a 9-inch pie pan. Bake in pie pan according to pie crust instructions, until golden brown. Set aside while preparing the pie filling.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, lightly beat your egg yolks and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine brown sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt and cinnamon with the two cups of milk. Whisk together and cook until thickened (it should be a thick consistency so could take up to 10-15 minutes depending on heat level, but this can vary, so be sure it is thick before going to the next step).</li>
        <li>Temper eggs by adding a spoonful of hot mixture to the egg yolks. Gradually whisk in egg yolks to saucepan and stir well.</li>
        <li>Stir in butter and vanilla extract. Cook, whisking regularly, for another 5 minutes. Mixture should thicken up again.</li>
        <li>Pour pie filling into prepared pie pan and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before refrigerating for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight) until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, garnish with a dollop of whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon to pie and enjoy!</li>
